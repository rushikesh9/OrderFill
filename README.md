# Bugs

OrderFill is tested in a limited environment and doesn't come under any guaranty,

1: Repeated Orders in Amibroker

Some afl codes keep generating buy/sell signals when condition is true more than once 
This problem occurs due to incorrect logic in code 

FIX: There is a included afl code that creates a flag when order is sent and waits for (n)time until new orders can be placed.


2: Orders don't get sent if there's a blank line in watch list

FIX: Don't use spaces between symbol names in market watch


3 For Trading MCX future use files with _mcx
